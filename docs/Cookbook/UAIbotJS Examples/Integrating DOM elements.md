# Interactive simulation

UAIbotJS is built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. This means that you can easily integrate it into your web application. In this example, we show you how to integrate UAIbotJS into a web page and how to control the cube with sliders. You can play around with the code by clicking the "Edit in JSFiddle" button.
